Our QC engineers check and balance each motor before shipping to the HobbyKing.com warehouse.   Specs: Model: NTM Prop Drive 35-36A 1800 Kv: 1800rpm/v Max current: 65A Max Power: 700W @ 12v (3S) / 875W @ 15v (4S) Shaft: 4mm Weight: 120g ESC: 70A Cell count: 3s~4s Lipoly Bolt holes: 18.9mm & 25mm Bolt thread: M3 Connection: 3.5mm Bullet-connector Suggested Prop: Prop test data coming soon!   A great plane motor  up to .30 size.

Because we design and build these motors completely in-house (from 3D/2D drawing to materials sourcing, machining, balancing, final assembly and dyno) we can completely control production and ensure product consistency from design right through to shipping the product to you. The removal of middle-men has meant we can drive better value to the market and retail these motors at factory(our) prices! All performance figures are real and tested on our own motor dynos. Perfect Kv and size for quadcopters! Our QC engineers check and balance each motor before shipping to the HobbyKing.com warehouse.   Specs: Model: NTM Prop Drive Series 28-30A 1000kv Kv: 1000rpm/v Max current: 25A Max Power: 278W @ 12v (3S) / 370W @ 15v (4S) Shaft: 3mm Weight: 68g ESC: 25A Cell count: 2~4S Lipoly Bolt holes: 16mm & 19mm Bolt thread: M3 Connection: 3.5mm Bullet-connector Suggested Prop: Prop test data coming soon!

Each and every SK3 Competition Series motor is thoroughly inspected and tested to ensure the high efficiency and top performance required for meeting the demands of competition flying. Turnigy GliderDrive Competition Series motors are top quality outrunners designed specifically for use in today's high performance glider models. These motors are effectively an 'outrunner in a can' meaning that the outside of the motor does not spin. This gives you the mounting advantages of an inrunner by not having to worry about clearance for the outside of the motor can to spin. They also feature a tapered front end allowing them to fit into the slim nose of most gliders/hotliners with ease. We instructed our engineers to source the best quality magnets, bearings and materials available to them and develop a motor that would not only rival, but surpass the quality of many leading motor manufacturers on the market today. The result is an efficient, high caliber motor using quality double shielded bearings, sintered Neodymium magnets and a string wound stator ensuring an accurate and consistent winding each and every time. The Turnigy SK3 motors are suited to modelers who are seeking a top quality brushless motor without compromise. This motor is designed for use in gliders/hotliners running on 3~4S Lipo batteries and swinging propellers in the range of 10~13 inch diameter.

Each and every SK3 Competition Series motor is thoroughly inspected and tested to ensure the high efficiency and top performance required for meeting the demands of competition flying. Turnigy GliderDrive Competition Series motors are top quality outrunners designed specifically for use in today's high performance glider models. These motors are effectively an 'outrunner in a can' meaning that the outside of the motor does not spin. This gives you the mounting advantages of an inrunner by not having to worry about clearance for the outside of the motor can to spin. They also feature a tapered front end allowing them to fit into the slim nose of most gliders/hotliners with ease. We instructed our engineers to source the best quality magnets, bearings and materials available to them and develop a motor that would not only rival, but surpass the quality of many leading motor manufacturers on the market today. The result is an efficient, high caliber motor using quality double shielded bearings, sintered Neodymium magnets and a string wound stator ensuring an accurate and consistent winding each and every time. The Turnigy SK3 motors are suited to modelers who are seeking a top quality brushless motor without compromise. This motor is designed for use in gliders/hotliners running on 3~4S Lipo batteries and swinging propellers in the range of 10~12 inch diameter.
